imagine you have a toy box and you want to keep your toys organized. you can use a special box with different 
compartments, each labeled with a name of a toy so that you can easily find the toy you want to play with

a python dictionary is similar to that special box it ia a way to store data in compartments called 'keys' and 'values
just like  how you label the compartments in your toy box with the name of your toys you can label the compartments
in a python dictionary with 'keys' which are like names and put some 'values' which are like toys themselves
